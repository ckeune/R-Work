R Code to Generate the Simulated Data and Run All Analyses
# The goal is to show all the R code that you would need
# to reproduce everything that has been reported.
# We will use the mvtnorm package in order to randomly 
# generate a data set with a given correlation pattern.

# First, we create a matrix of factor loadings.
# This pattern is called bifactor because it has a 
# general factor with loadings from all the items
# and specific factors for separate components.
# The outcome variables are also formed as 
# combinations of these general and specific factors.
